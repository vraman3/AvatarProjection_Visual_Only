# AvatarProjection_Visual_Only
Images and video of the facial features of a user being tracked by a sensor, which is then captured in real-time in Unity. The real-time capture is then projected on to a screen.

The Github preview for images shows a very zoomed-in part of the images. Please click 'Download' to see the full proper images.

The project was supervised by [Prof. Joe Geigel](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~jmg/) and [Prof. Marla Schweppe](https://www.rit.edu/directory/mkspph-marla-schweppe) from Rochester Institute of Technology
